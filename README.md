# Smart-Health-Prediction-System

There are various diseases which are considered as deadly and chronic, and it would help the patients if these diseases were diagnosed at the earliest stage. Many complications occur if these diseases remain untreated and unidentified. The aim of developing classifier system using machine learning algorithms is to immensely help to solve the health-related issues by assisting the physicians to predict and diagnose diseases at an early stage.
Our proposed system is an end-to-end data science project that is able to predict the chances of getting diseases, based on the blood test report results of the user. In this project, the risk of getting diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Kidney Disease, Liver Disease and Breast Cancer, is predicted using various machine learning algorithms. The final output is predicted based on the most accurate machine learning algorithm. A web application is designed where the user will have the convenience to select the disease they want consultancy on and enter their blood test report details. Then, the system uses the most accurate model which can prognosticate the likelihood of the selected disease in patients.
